        <!-- Alternate Racial Traits -->
        <trait>
            <name>Dayrunner (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Orcs refuse to yield to any foe, including the sun. Some spend hour upon hour glaring at the sun until their ruined eyes acclimatize to bright light. Orcs with this racial trait take a –2 penalty on all ranged attack rolls. This racial trait replaces light sensitivity.</text>
            <modifier category = "bonus">Ranged Attack -2</modifier>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Feral (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Orcs have the ability to fend for themselves long before they master the rudiments of their language and culture. Having needed to hunt bugs and tiny animals for food to survive while still infants, feral orcs fight all the harder to survive when at the brink of death. Orcs with this racial trait gain Survival as a class skill and gain a +1 racial bonus on melee weapon attack and damage rolls when at negative hit points. This racial trait replaces the orc’s weapon familiarity and automatic languages. Feral orcs without additional languages due to high Intelligence scores or ranks in Linguistics can only communicate with grunts and gestures.</text>

            <name>Reckless Climber (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Mountain-dwelling orcs thrive on taking insane risks to defeat foes and show up rivals. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks without rope and on Acrobatics checks to maintain balance. This racial trait replaces ferocity.</text>

            <name>Smeller (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Orcs with this racial trait gain a limited scent ability with half the normal range. This racial trait replaces ferocity and weapon familiarity.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Squalid (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Some orcs exist in surroundings so filthy and pestilent that even other orcs would have difficulty living in them. Orcs with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws made to resist nausea, the sickened condition, and disease. This racial trait replaces ferocity.</text>
