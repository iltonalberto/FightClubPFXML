            <name>Shadow Magic</name>
            <text>Wayangs add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against spells of the shadow subschool that they cast. Wayangs with a Charisma score of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—ghost sound, pass without trace, and ventriloquism. The caster level for these effects is equal to the wayang’s level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the wayang’s Charisma modifier.</text>

        <!-- Alternate Racial Traits -->
        <trait>
            <name>Dissolution’s Child (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Once per day, you may change your appearance to look as if you were little more than a 4-foot-tall area of shadow. Your physical form still exists and you are not incorporeal—only your appearance changes. This works like invisibility, except it only lasts 1 round per level (maximum 5 rounds). This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.</text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>In the Shadows (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Many wayangs perform a variety of unusual roles and tasks in wayang society. They gain a +2 racial bonus on their choice of two of the following skills: Appraise, Bluff, Craft, Profession, and Sleight of Hand. This racial trait replaces lurker. </text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Poison Minion (4 RP) (Alternate Racial Traits)</name>
            <text>Drow sometimes augment their slaves and frontline warriors by making them toxic, causing their bodies to internally produce mawbane poison (see below). The resulting poisonous creature makes a potent weapon in the effort to discourage neighboring monsters. Any creature that hits such a character with a bite attack is immediately exposed to its poison. The save DC for this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s Hit Dice + the character’s Constitution modifier. Mawbane Poison—ingested; save Fortitude as above; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 1 save. Wayangs can take this trait in place of light and dark, lurker, and shadow resistance.</text>
